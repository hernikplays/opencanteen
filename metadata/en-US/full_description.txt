OpenCanteen is an alternative free open-source client for the iCanteen food ordering system.

Using this app, you can:
- browse the menu of your iCanteen instance
- order or cancel meals
- place food into or the exchange
- have a notification displayed at a defined time with info about the ordered meal

The app may not work on every iCanteen instance, so in case of any bugs, make sure to open an issue in the repo.
